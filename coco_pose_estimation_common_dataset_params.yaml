The oks_sigmas array defines the sigma values for the Object Keypoint Similarity (OKS) metric for each keypoint. I've estimated these values based on the typical proportions of a bottle, but you may need to adjust them based on your specific dataset and requirements. Smaller sigma values indicate tighter localization requirements for those keypoints.

The edge_links define the connections between the keypoints, forming the outline of the bottle shape.

I've also included the edge_colors and keypoint_colors arrays to specify visualization colors for the edges and keypoints respectively. Feel free to modify these colors based on your preferences.

Since the bottle shape is generally symmetrical, I've left the flip_indexes array empty, assuming you don't need to define specific keypoint flipping for data augmentation.
